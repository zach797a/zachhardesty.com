<p><strong>Addons usage</strong><br>
All addons purchased under a single account should and can be used only with a single admin panel.</p>
<p><strong>Addons renewals</strong><br>
Annual renewals will be 50% of the original addon price. The addons’ price includes updates + support for one year. After the one-year period, you can still own the addons without renewing. But you will not have access to updates and support. Please note that, as WordPress releases updates regularly, we have to keep the admin panel updated. This may make certain old version of addons incompatible with the latest version of the admin panel and you will have to renew the addons to continue using it.</p>
<p><strong>Addon Suite renewal</strong><br>
Annual renewal of the Addon Suite is $199 (50% of the original price).</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Solution usage</strong><br>
The Enterprise Solution can be used only within your team / organisation. You CAN NOT create accounts for your customers and provide it as a value-added, hosted service. Rebranding the InfiniteWP admin panel is also strictly prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Refund Policy</strong><br>
We will process your refund request, no questions asked, within 14 days of your purchase if you are unable to install the product(s) or if the product(s) fails to perform the basic claimed functionality. Under no circumstance will refunds be given after a period of 14 days from the date of purchase. Refunds do not apply to addon license renewals and the expert installation service. </p>

<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What our support does not include</span></div>
<div>Fix compatibility issues with your server-</div>
<p>As you know, WordPress is installed on varying types of servers. While we do our best to make the app compatible with any environment, it is not possible to assure the same. We can help you find issues and point you in the right direction.</p>
<div>Fix compatibility issues with other themes and plugins-</div>
<p>We strive hard to make the app compatible with everything WordPress. However, a lot of other things (like the 27,114 plugins and 2,034 themes in the WP repository and a lot more premium ones) are beyond our control. If you have a problem involving one of these, there isn’t much we can do. We can, however, take a look and give our suggestions.</p>
<div>Fix issues with other services which we connect via API-</div>
<p>We have a few addons that connect with other services for functionalities like uptime monitoring, malware scanning etc.. Since we only just connect to them via their API, we cannot fix any issues with them since we do not have any control over that. You have to contact them directly for any assistance.</p>
<div>Add features to InfiniteWP</div>
<p>Many of the features in the app has its root with the users themselves. There are still a few great ideas waiting to be implemented. If you have one, we will take it seriously, as always, and discuss with you. But we can’t promise anything.</p>
<div>Bug Fixing</div>
<p>It is our commitment to fix all bugs as quickly as possible after they are brought to our attention. We will also try to provide a temporary solution via the Support Forum for smaller bugs, which we may include in the next update. But we cannot assure that all bugs will be fixed immediately.</p>
